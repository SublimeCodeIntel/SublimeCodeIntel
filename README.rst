Installing
----------
**With the Package Control plugin:** The easiest way to install SublimeCodeIntel is through Package Control, which can be found at this site: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

Once you install Package Control, restart ST2 and bring up the Command Palette (``Command+Shift+P`` on OS X, ``Control+Shift+P`` on Linux/Windows). Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list, then select SublimeCodeIntel when the list appears. The advantage of using this method is that Package Control will automatically keep SublimeCodeIntel up to date with the latest version.

**Without Git:** Download the latest source from `GitHub <http://github.com/Kronuz/SublimeCodeIntel>`_ and copy the whole directory into the Packages directory.

**With Git:** Clone the repository in your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory, located somewhere in user's "Home" directory::

    git clone git://github.com/Kronuz/SublimeCodeIntel.git


The "Packages" packages directory is located at:

* OS X::

    ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/

* Linux::

    ~/.Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/

* Windows::

    %APPDATA%/Sublime Text 2/Packages/


Using
-----

* Sublime CodeIntel will allow you to jump around symbol definitions even across files with just a click. To "Jump to Symbol Declaration" use ``super+f3`` or ``alt+click`` over the symbol. To go back to previous jump point use ``cmd+alt+ctrl+left``.

* Start typing code as usual, autocomplete will pop up whenever it's available. To trigger manual codeintel autocompletion use ``shift+ctrl+space``.

Don't despair! The first time you use it it needs to build some indexes and it can take more than a few seconds (around six in my configuration).

It just works!

If you find the behaviour somewhat unexpected or the autocomplete incomplete, please reset the plugin from sublimetext command palette before trying anything else.


Configuring
-----------
For adding additional library paths (django and extra libs paths for Python or extra paths to look for .js files for JavaScript for example), either add those paths as folders to your project, or create an optional codeintel configuration file in your home or in your project's root.

Configuration files (``~/.codeintel/config`` or ``project_root/.codeintel/config``). All configurations are optional. Example::

    {
        "PHP": {
            "php": '/usr/bin/php',
            "phpExtraPaths": [],
            "phpConfigFile": 'php.ini'
        },
        "JavaScript": {
            "javascriptExtraPaths": []
        },
        "Perl": {
            "perl": "/usr/bin/perl",
            "perlExtraPaths": []
        },
        "Ruby": {
            "ruby": "/usr/bin/ruby",
            "rubyExtraPaths": []
        },
        "Python": {
            "python": '/usr/bin/python',
            "pythonExtraPaths": []
        },
        "Python3": {
            "python": '/usr/bin/python3',
            "pythonExtraPaths": []
        }
    }

Additional settings can be configured in the User File Settings:

* A list of disabled languages can be set using "codeintel_disabled_languages". Ex. ``"codeintel_disabled_languages": ['css']``

* Live autocomplete can be disabled by setting "codeintel_live" to false.

* Live autocompletion can be disabled in a per-language basis, using "codeintel_live_disabled_languages". Ex. ``"codeintel_live_disabled_languages": ['css']``

* Information for more settings is available in the ``Base File.sublime-settings`` file.


Troubleshooting
---------------

Using ``build.sh``


If everything else fails, try rebuilding the libraries using ``build.sh``.
You need to install some things to make sure it's going to work.
These are likely to be packaged on your system, such as, for Ubuntu/Debian-like
distros. Open a terminal and do::

    $ sudo apt-get install g++

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev

Once you have installed those, you may need to use the ``build.sh`` script.
In your terminal, go to your ``Packages/SublimeCodeIntel/src`` folder, then
simply run::

    $ ./build.sh



What's New
----------
v1.3 (20-12-2011):

* This build should fix many of the problems seen in Linux systems.

* Libraries for Linux rebuilt with libpcre statically (libpcre bundled for Linux builds).

* ``calltip()`` is now thread safe (which caused some strange behavior in Linux where Sublime Text 2 ended up being unresponsive).


v1.2 (18-12-2011):

* JavaScript support improved (it's now much nicer with the CPU).

* CSS files support much improved (thanks to Jon's new features in autocomplete).

* Added palette commands to disable/enable the plugin in many ways.

* Added ``codeintel_live_disabled_languages`` and fixed ``codeintel_live`` to disable SublimeCodeIntel live autocomplete mode.

* Smarter language detection and fallbacks.

* Improved autocomplete triggering, should now respond better.

* Support for new completion settings in Sublime Text 2 Build 2148.
