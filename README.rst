Installing
----------
**With the Package Control plugin:** The easiest way to install SublimeCodeIntel is through Package Control, which can be found at this site: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

Once you install Package Control, restart Sublime Text and bring up the Command Palette (``Command+Shift+P`` on OS X, ``Control+Shift+P`` on Linux/Windows). Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list, then select SublimeCodeIntel when the list appears. The advantage of using this method is that Package Control will automatically keep SublimeCodeIntel up to date with the latest version.

**Without Git:** Download the latest source from `GitHub <http://github.com/SublimeCodeIntel/SublimeCodeIntel>`_ and copy the whole directory into the Packages directory.

**With Git:** Clone the repository in your Sublime Text Packages directory, located somewhere in user's "Home" directory::

    git clone git://github.com/SublimeCodeIntel/SublimeCodeIntel.git


The "Packages" packages directory is located differently in different platforms. To access the directory use:

* OS X::

    Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages...

* Linux::

    Preferences -> Browse Packages...

* Windows::

    Preferences -> Browse Packages...


Using
-----

* Start typing code as usual, autocomplete will pop up whenever it's available. SublimeCodeIntel will also allow you to jump around symbol definitions even across files with just a click ..and back.

  For Linux:
    * Jump to definition = ``Control+Click``
    * Jump to definition = ``Control+Command+Alt+Up``
    * Go back = ``Control+Command+Alt+Left``
    * Manual Code Intelligence = ``Control+Shift+space``

  For Mac OS X:
    * Jump to definition = ``Super+Click``
    * Jump to definition = ``Control+Super+Alt+Up``
    * Go back = ``Control+Super+Alt+Left``
    * Manual Code Intelligence = ``Control+Shift+space``

  For Windows:
    * Jump to definition = ``Alt+Click``
    * Jump to definition = ``Control+Windows+Alt+Up``
    * Go back = ``Control+Windows+Alt+Left``
    * Manual Code Intelligence = ``Control+Shift+space``

Don't despair! The first time you use it it needs to build some indexes and it can take more than a few seconds.

It just works!


Configuring
-----------
For adding additional library paths (django and extra libs paths for Python or extra paths to look for .js files for JavaScript for example), either add those paths as folders to your project, or create an optional codeintel configuration file in your home or in your project's root.

Configuration files (``~/.codeintel/config`` or ``project_root/.codeintel/config``). All configurations are optional. Example::

    {
        "PHP": {
            "php": '/usr/bin/php',
            "phpExtraPaths": [],
            "phpConfigFile": 'php.ini'
        },
        "JavaScript": {
            "javascriptExtraPaths": []
        },
        "Perl": {
            "perl": "/usr/bin/perl",
            "perlExtraPaths": []
        },
        "Ruby": {
            "ruby": "/usr/bin/ruby",
            "rubyExtraPaths": []
        },
        "Python": {
            "python": '/usr/bin/python',
            "pythonExtraPaths": []
        },
        "Python3": {
            "python": '/usr/bin/python3',
            "pythonExtraPaths": []
        }
    }

Additional settings can be configured in the User File Settings:

Do NOT edit the default SublimeCodeIntel settings. Your changes will be lost when SublimeCodeIntel is updated. ALWAYS edit the user SublimeCodeIntel settings by selecting "Preferences->Package Settings->SublimeCodeIntel->Settings - User". Note that individual settings you include in your user settings will **completely** replace the corresponding default setting, so you must provide that setting in its entirety.

Available settings:

* A list of disabled languages can be set using "codeintel_disabled_languages". Ex. ``"codeintel_disabled_languages": ['css']``

* Live autocomplete can be disabled by setting "codeintel_live" to false.

* Live autocompletion can be disabled in a per-language basis, using "codeintel_live_disabled_languages". Ex. ``"codeintel_live_disabled_languages": ['css']``

* Information for more settings is available in the ``SublimeCodeIntel.sublime-settings`` file in the package.


Troubleshooting
---------------

To force re-indexation of the code intelligence database you need to follow these steps:

* Close Sublime Text

* Open a terminal or navigate through your directories to find the directory ``~/.codeintel`` that contains ``codeintel.log``, ``VERSION`` and the directory ``db``. In Windows, this should be at ``%userprofile%\.codeintel``.

* Delete the whole directory ``~/.codeintel`` and all of its content. Particularly, if you want to delete only the indexes, the code intelligence database indexes are located inside ``~/.codeintel/db``.

* Start Sublime Text and enjoy a clean re-indexing!


Building
--------

Building process is no longer distributed with this repository. You need to get SublimeCodeIntel/`CodeIntelSources <https://github.com/SublimeCodeIntel/CodeIntelSources/>`_ to run ``build.sh``.

More information in SublimeCodeIntel/CodeIntelSources/`src <https://github.com/SublimeCodeIntel/CodeIntelSources/src>`_.
